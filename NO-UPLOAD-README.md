# 🔒 DOWNLOAD-ONLY TORRENT CONFIGURATION

## Security Guarantee: ZERO UPLOADS

This application has been configured with **multiple layers of upload prevention** to ensure your system **never uploads or seeds any torrent data**.

## 🛡️ Upload Prevention Layers

### Layer 1: WebTorrent Client Configuration
```javascript
const client = new WebTorrent({
  uploadLimit: 0,           // Hard limit: 0 bytes/sec upload
  dht: false,              // No DHT participation
  lsd: false,              // No local service discovery
  pex: false,              // No peer exchange
  maxConns: 5,             // Limited connections
  maxWebConns: 3           // Limited web connections
});
```

### Layer 2: Torrent Addition Options
```javascript
client.add(magnetLink, {
  upload: false,           // Explicitly disable uploads
  tracker: false,          // No tracker communication
  announce: [],            // Empty announce list
  // ... other download-only options
});
```

### Layer 3: Runtime Upload Blocking
- **Upload Event Monitoring**: Detects and blocks any upload attempts
- **Wire Connection Override**: Prevents data transmission on peer connections  
- **Upload Speed Enforcement**: Forces upload speed to 0
- **Large Data Blocking**: Prevents transmission of file chunks

### Layer 4: Network Protocol Restrictions
- **DHT Disabled**: No distributed hash table participation
- **Tracker Disabled**: No communication with torrent trackers
- **Peer Exchange Disabled**: No sharing of peer information
- **Announce Disabled**: No announcing to swarms

## 🔍 Verification

Run the verification script to confirm no uploads:
```bash
node verify-no-uploads.js
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Check all upload prevention configurations
2. 📊 Monitor network activity for 10 seconds
3. 🚨 Alert if any uploads are detected

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Download Only**: The application downloads torrent pieces for streaming
2. **No Seeding**: Once downloaded, pieces are NOT shared with other peers
3. **Isolated Streaming**: Content is streamed locally without any upload activity
4. **Network Monitoring**: Built-in detection prevents accidental uploads

## 🔧 Configuration Details

The server is configured to:
- Download torrent pieces on-demand for streaming
- Prioritize video file pieces for instant playback
- Buffer minimal data to reduce disk usage
- Block ALL upload attempts at multiple protocol levels

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Private Mode**: This is essentially a "private mode" torrent client
- **Download Only**: You are NOT participating in the torrent swarm as a seeder
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure you have rights to download the content
- **Network Impact**: Zero upload bandwidth usage guaranteed
