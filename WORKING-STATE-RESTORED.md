# ✅ WORKING STATE RESTORED - Universal Torrent Resolution System

## 🔄 What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Torrents were getting added but couldn't be viewed - "not found" errors when navigating to torrent details.

**Root Cause**: The clean version only kept torrents in memory and the GET endpoint couldn't reload missing torrents.

**Solution**: Restored the **Universal Torrent Resolution System** which can:
- ✅ Add torrents successfully  
- ✅ View torrents even after server memory clears
- ✅ Automatically reload torrents on-demand
- ✅ Multiple fallback strategies for finding torrents

## 🚀 Current System Status

### Backend: Universal Torrent Resolution System

- **File**: `index-universal.js` (deployed as `index.js`)
- **Features**: 
  - 6-strategy torrent resolution
  - Automatic on-demand loading
  - Zero upload security maintained
  - Comprehensive torrent tracking

### Frontend: Working Integration
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173`
- **Navigation**: Correctly uses `data.infoHash` for routing
- **API Integration**: Properly sends `{ torrentId: magnetLink }` format
- **Environment**: Configured for correct ports

## 🎯 Universal Resolution Strategies

1. **Direct Hash Match**: Check if torrent exists in memory
2. **ID Lookup**: Search by stored torrent IDs  
3. **Name Lookup**: Find by torrent name

5. Frontend navigates to `/torrent/{infoHash}`

### View Flow:
1. User visits `/torrent/{infoHash}`
2. Universal resolver tries 6 strategies
3. If not found in memory, auto-reloads
4. Returns torrent details or helpful error
